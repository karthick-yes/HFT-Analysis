# HFT_BTC: High-Frequency Trading Analysis for Bitcoin

## Project Overview

This project analyzes high-frequency trading (HFT) patterns in the Bitcoin market, with a particular focus on identifying and classifying "flashed orders". Our analysis revealed that a significant portion of market orders are potentially used to distort market perception.

## Key Findings

- Over 90% of market orders placed were identified as "flashed orders"
- These orders appear to be primarily used to create a false impression of market depth or liquidity
- Visualization techniques were employed to better understand and illustrate this phenomenon

## Machine Learning Model

Developing a machine learning model to classify orders as either flashed or non-flashed. 

### Model Details
- Type: Binary Classification(RandomForestClassifier, SVM or even an Ensemble)
- Target: Flashed Order (Yes/No)
- Features: [List key features used in the model]
- Algorithms Tested: [Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression]

### Performance
